Quastions: 

1- The main idea of our project plan ?

we used four classes to implement our porject
- Books     (This class contains the methods of book like: add_book , delete_book ...)
- Users     (This class contains the methods of user like: add_user , delete_user ...)
- LMS       (This class inherits the methods of book class and user class and have the init method as a constructor , this constructor Requests [book list file] , [users list file] , and this class deal with the dictionary of book and user)
- Run       (In this class we have the options screen to select Admin or User mode then and then perform the operations, this class import LMS class and get all the functions in it)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- What we can do if we want to inhance our project in the future ?

we can just replace the files of books and users to CSV files, this way
can give us more bilt in fuctions to make the code easier and readable
more , and easier to deal with it in the future.

3- How to Run the program ?

In our project you can simply run the program from "Run class"
